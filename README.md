Welcome to my space! This repository showcases a collection of random projects I’ve been working on to improve my coding skills, experiment with new ideas, and simply have fun building things.

These projects vary in size and complexity — from small utilities to creative experiments — but they all reflect my learning journey as an Information Technology student and my passion for solving problems through code.
